  - Clean separation between client and server logic

### ✨ Features
  - Send HTTP requests with customizable methods and payloads
  - Inspect complete API responses including status and data
  - Save requests for later reuse
  - Organize requests into collections
  - Local-first setup suitable for offline development
  - Minimal and focused UI for faster testing workflows
